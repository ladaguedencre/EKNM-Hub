The universe in the tunnel is both similar and unlike many other universes, including our reality. In it, both game and non-game characters have their own history, character, characteristics, appearance, knowledge and skills. Among all the various forms of life in this world, only a few are worthy of being called intelligent, and it is these races that can be your character.

> Your character can be a human, lithoid, dendroid, fungoid, beastman, spectral, elemental, or swarm</b></p>

In addition to race, your character will have to choose traits, including racial, religious, and handicaps; one of over 50 backstories; skills; as well as schools of magic and/or fighting styles. With such wide customization possibilities, you can create both a smart and mysterious mage, and a brave charismatic warrior, and any other image of your mind, even outside the framework of classic RPG types.

> The schools of organic magic, psionics, draft, geometry and 4 branches of elemental magic are available to you. And also 5 different fighting styles with variations of development.

Since the world of PUP is in a technological development similar to our renaissance era, in addition to classic and exotic melee weapons, you will have the opportunity to use crossbows, muskets and other mechanical devices. Cities are noticeably larger and more complex than in the Middle Ages, science is developing, albeit in its own special way. Much of this incredible world is already available to play:
- More than 60 variants of weapons of different materials and purposes
- Over 35 artifacts of varying rarity and power
- Well-thought-out system of alchemy, ingredients and recipes
- 18 stacking effects, including a violent orgasm
- AIDS, leprosy and PTSD

### Development plan
We are translating the player's book into Ukrainian, and a web version of the player's book is also planned. By running games regularly, we improve the balance and make adjustments to improve the game system.
