### Season 2

This was a simple build for a classic game compatible with the vanilla game client. The server has plugins for privatizing the territory, improved mechanisms, brewing beer and a bunch of trinkets that improve the gaming experience, but do not interfere with enjoying the classic minecraft.  

Game version - `1.19.4`  

A large year-round sawmill with many rooms, an official hall and merchants was built on the spawning grounds. A small village of local residents is located next to it. This area is surrounded by forests, and rivers flow nearby. Can you imagine a better location for a home?

### 1 season

In early 2020, we launched the first public EKNM minecraft server with mods, massive spawning, and plans to expand the project. A video about Luntik and the coronavirus was also filmed on this server. The mod pack has been compiled with a magic and exploration theme, with additional dimensions and improved NPCs.  

The following were built on the server:
- Three-tower spawnpoint
- A large NPC city with a cathedral
- A bombed-out village
- Mine with bats
- Mausoleum
- Headquarters in the rock
- Abandoned fortress
- System of underground railways
- Hospital
- Favelas
- Penthouse above the slums
- Ice track for boating
- Luntik's secret office
- Private homes of players

### Other

.We also worked on the development of our launcher for a more comfortable game. Unfortunately, it was not finished due to a premature shutdown of the server. You can familiarize yourself with it on ``Github'':
