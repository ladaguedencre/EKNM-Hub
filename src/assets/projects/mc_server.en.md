### Welcome to our server

EKNM Minecraft Server Classic is a simple build for the classic game, compatible with the vanilla game client. The server has plugins for privatizing the territory, improved mechanisms, brewing beer and a bunch of trinkets that improve the gaming experience, but do not interfere with enjoying the classic minecraft.

The current version is `1.19.4`

No wipes are currently planned.

A large year-round sawmill with many rooms, an official hall and merchants was built on the spawning grounds. A small village of local residents is located next to it. This area is surrounded by forests, and rivers flow nearby. Can you imagine a better location for a home?

### Server history

.This server is not the first one we have launched. You can read about the last large-scale launch in the archive:

.[First public EKNM Minecraft server](http://localhost:4200/archive/first_mc_server)  

.We also worked on the development of our launcher for a more comfortable game. Unfortunately, it was not finished due to a premature shutdown of the server. You can familiarize yourself with it on `Github`:
