### General concept

SCP: WA is a real-time global strategy. The player manages the SCP Foundation on behalf of the Founder. The main goal is to contain various anomalies that appear in the world during the game. The player will have to develop an agent network to detect new anomalies as quickly as possible, create mobile task forces, improve them for immediate detention, and also build and develop zones in which anomalous objects will be kept. At the same time, the activities of the Foundation should remain in the shadows, humanity should not know about the existence of something different from the world they are used to. There are three types of resources in the game:
- Experience
- Knowledge
- Class-D

The player gains experience by successfully capturing and restraining anomalous objects. Due to experience, you can hire new employees of the Foundation, increase the number of zones available for construction, increase the influence of the Foundation in the world, and more. The increase in knowledge depends on the number of anomalous objects and the study of their properties. The speed of technology research depends on the speed of knowledge growth. Research can be conducted in various areas: equipping the MOG, construction of zones, methods of maintaining objects, etc. Class D is necessary to support the growth of knowledge - a human resource that is spent studying anomalous objects. Class D growth depends on the Fund's influence in the world.

There are many endings in the game, among which only one is good - the Foundation was able to spread its influence around the world and put all the objects on hold. In other cases, any anomalous object is not under the control of the Foundation, which leads to one of the scenarios of the end of the world or the cancellation of the secret activities of the Foundation.

### Progress of the game

The map is divided into regions, in each region it is possible to build a zone. First, the player starts with one zone, randomly selected from several starting zones. Next, he explores the region, gets resources, creates new zones. And so on. Construction in the regions is possible only with sufficient influence from neighboring regions. It is also possible to choose the initial branch:

Objects appear during exploration of the region or randomly. They can be static (fixed) or movable. Each object has a class determined by field agents, MOGs, or scientists. Objects provide one-time, temporary or permanent resource buffs/debuffs. Temporary and permanent buffs/debuffs are activated by scientists. Some objects have their own micro-events (probable or planned), for example, violation of conditions of maintenance or transportation, or even a change of class.

### Basic gameplay elements

.Committee O5 - votes in important decisions, in case of death, a choice is made among scientists, commanders of the Ministry of Defense, administration.
.Scientists - hired for experience, have characteristics (character), assigned to the zone, can investigate objects in the region.
.MOG - are created in the MOG designer, have special characteristics, there is a limited choice during creation.
.Field agents - also have a limited selection of characteristics. They go to an unknown object, maintain secrecy.
.Technologies - divided into 3 branches: Security (finding, capturing objects, improving MOG, etc.), Containment (containment of objects, cameras, zones, etc.), Protection (everything related to the population and secrecy).

### Development process

We worked out the concept and mechanics at the prototype level, and as a result of several meetings, development began. The menu, zone selection and map prototype were made. The mechanics of opening new territories, building zones and the appearance of objects have been implemented. Unfortunately, after that, the development was stopped. The main reasons for this were insufficient manpower to create a game of this scale, the emergence of competing games, and most importantly [DATA EXPUNGED]
